Tired of answering questions about her job and recent travels, Rebecca wrote in her OkCupid dating profile, "message me if you want to talk about my family's new puppy." Tavi's first message was about the new puppy, Shadow. Good thing we both love dogs! We met in November 2013 at Piccolo Cafe, two blocks from where we now live in New York. We got engaged on April 15, 2017 after Tavi's elaborate proposal weekend of secretly canceled flights to LA, a photo book filled with puppies, friends, family, and Kosher for Passover cake. We look forward to celebrating our wedding with all of you a year to the date after our engagement!
