If you feel inclined to give us a gift, thank you so much!

We've set up a donor-advised fund (DAF) with the Jewish Communal Fund, which is essentially our own mini foundation ([learn more about DAFs here](https://www.jcfny.org/donor-advised-fund)). Gifts to our fund are tax-deductible just like any other charitable donation. We will be able to direct the money in our fund to secular or Jewish non-profit organizations that we want to support.

We'd prefer donations to our donor-advised fund in lieu of physical gifts. We are very fortunate to have everything we need to start our married lives together, but not everyone is so fortunate. Giving/tzedakah is a value we both share and we've made a meaningful donation ourselves to open this fund.
