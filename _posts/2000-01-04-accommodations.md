We have reserved a block of rooms at the Hyatt at $129/night. If you plan to stay at the Hyatt, [please reserve your rooms as soon as possible using this link](https://aws.passkey.com/go/kaufmannathanson). The rooms are refundable up until 24 hours before your stay.

If you run into any issues with room availability for King or Double rooms, just let us know. This likely means that we need to expand the block of rooms.
